## Responsiveness Testing

The deployed website underwent extensive testing across a spectrum of devices and screen sizes to guarantee its responsiveness and adaptability. Developer Tools were instrumental in simulating diverse screen dimensions, facilitating a comprehensive evaluation of the website's behavior on various devices.
A combination of Bootstrap classes, custom CSS, and template syntax played a pivotal role in crafting the desired design. This strategic implementation not only ensured visual consistency but also maintained functional integrity across different platforms. By leveraging these tools and techniques, the website is poised to deliver an optimized user experience, regardless of the device being used.

## Bugs

### Resolved Bugs

#### Sorting error when category is None

* When user choose option to sort products by category from the navbar menu and there were products without category name the applicaton stopped work and throw error. The issue was fixed by updating sorting logic (logic was updated for all sorting to prevent similar issues). Also, Not Available category was added to the model as defaul for all products.

<details>
<summary> Code changes
</summary>

products/views.py

```python

sortkey = request.GET['sort']
            sort = sortkey
            if sortkey == 'category':
                    # books = books.annotate(category_name=Lower('category__name'))
                    # comics = comics.annotate(category_name=Lower('category__name'))
                    books = books.annotate(category_name=Lower('category__name')).exclude(category__isnull=True)
                    comics = comics.annotate(category_name=Lower('category__name')).exclude(category__isnull=True)
                    products = list(chain(comics, books))
                    if 'direction' in request.GET:
                        direction = request.GET['direction']
                        # if direction == 'asc' or None:
                        if direction == 'asc' or direction is None:
                            products = sorted(products, key=lambda x: x.category_name)
                        else:
                            products = sorted(products, key=lambda x: x.category_name, reverse=True)

```

products/models.py

```python

category = models.ForeignKey(
        'Category', null=True, blank=True, on_delete=models.SET_NULL,
        # default='Non Available'
        default=19
    )

```

</details>

#### Sorting error 500 on deployed project

* When user choose option to sort products the 500 error was displayed. It was caused by the use of union() on the queryset not support by SQL database. The issue was fixed by reverting to the use of list() and chain() methods to combine sorting results of two querysets and by sorting the result list in ascending or descending order.

<details>
<summary> Code changes
</summary>

products/views.py

```python

    # products = comics.union(books)
    product = list(chain(comics, books))
    
    # if 'direction' in request.GET:
    #     direction = request.GET['direction']
    #         if direction == 'desc':
    #             sortkey = f'-{sortkey}'
    if 'direction' in request.GET:
        direction = request.GET['direction']
        if direction == 'asc' or None:
            products = sorted(products, key=lambda x: x.product_title)
        else:
            products = sorted(products, key=lambda x: x.product_title, reverse=True)

```

</details>

#### User could add more than 10 units of the same product

* User wa able to add unlimited number of the same product to the basket, despite the maximum number of items set to 10. This was possible by repeating the addition to the basket by any number between 1 and 10. The issue was fixed by adding logic to the view, to prevent user from adding more product, when totla number of the same product reach 10.

<details>
<summary> Code changes
</summary>

bag/views.py

```python

    total_quantity = bag[item_id] + quantity
        if total_quantity > 10:
            messages.error(
                request, 'You can only add up to 10 items of the same product. '
                'If you wish to pruchase more products, please contact our customer support! '
            )
            return redirect(reverse('view_bag'))
        else:
            bag[item_id] = quantity
            messages.success(
                request, f'Successfully updated quantity of {product.title} to {quantity}!'
            )

```

</details>

#### User could add more than 10 or negative number of products

* User wa able to add unlimited number of the same product when updating the bag, or enter negative number of product which caused product to be deleted from the bag. The issue was fixed with the script that prevents user from adding number outside the range from 1 to 10.

<details>
<summary> Code changes
</summary>

bag/views.py

```javascript

$('.update-item').click(function (e) {
    e.preventDefault();
    var qtyInputVal = parseInt($(this).closest('.table-row').find('.qty_input').val());
    var productTitle = $(this).closest('.table-row').find('.qty_input').data('product_title');
    var itemId = $(this).closest('.table-row').find('.qty_input').data('item_id');
    var $errorDiv = $('#input-error-' + itemId);
    if (qtyInputVal > 0 && qtyInputVal < 11) {
        var form = $(this).closest('.table-row').find('.update-form');
        form.submit();
    } else {
        // alert(
        //     `You are attempting to add ${qtyInputVal} units of ${productTitle}. You can choose max 10 and min 1 product.`
        //  );
        $errorDiv.text(`You are attempting to add ${qtyInputVal} units of ${productTitle}. You can choose max 10 and min 1 product.`).removeClass('d-none');
        setTimeout(function() {
            $('.input-error').addClass('d-none');
        }, 15000); 
    }
});

```

</details>
